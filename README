The standard authentication approach for web directories on an Apache server is
to use .htaccess files to describe the permissions for a particular directory.
Configuring these files correctly can be quite irritating and, in many
scenarios, you simply want to re-use the system accounts for authentication.
The scripts in this repository are designed to simply creating .htaccess files
that reference the system accounts.

generate-htgroups.sh - Run this to generate a .htgroups file that matches the
    group setup of your system accounts.
generate-htpasswd.sh - Run this to generate a .htpasswd file that amalgamates
    the .htpasswd files from each user's home directory. This allows users to
    set their own password that is then updated in the global .htpasswd.
protect.py - Run this in a web directory to create a .htaccess file. Note that
    this script assumes you have used the generate scripts to create the files
    /var/www/.htgroups and /var/www/.htpasswd respectively.
